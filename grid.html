                The reason I chose Paris as my favourite city is because it is a place with a lot of history.
                Besides the Eiffel Tower I was always really fascinated by experiencing the infrastructure and the
                culture
                in
                Paris.
                I also feel a sense of tranquility, just existing in a moment of silence and looking at art, because for
                me
                it's almost like meditating.
                I always wanted to attend fashion week in Paris because its such a big event and it seems like quite the
                experience.
                Trying french cuisines in the country it originated from, is also a big dream of mine. I truly believe
                that
                I
                will be able to go to Paris, and it will be because of my music.
